------
> ### A few points:
> > To stop the bomber, use the keys `ctrl + D`
> > > If your terminal is unable to clone the file, download it [from here](https://github.com/NiREvil/sms-bomber/blob/main/sms-bomber.py)
> > > and then use the command `cd downloads` in the program instead of the command cd sms-bomber ,
cause the directory or location of the tool is now in the downloads folder of your phone's storage .
> > > > You can see which folder you are currently in with the command `pwd`.
> > > > > and the contents inside the folder will be displayed for you with the command `ls` .
> > > > > > Use the command `cd` followed by the name of the desired folder to navigate to that path.
